      <h1> What bogs you down or holds you back?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Career</li>

        <li>Family</li>
        <li>Financial overload?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful boyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, "who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?" Actually, who are you not to be? We were born to make manifest the glory that is within us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. - Marianne Williamson</p>
